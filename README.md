Welcome to my personal portfolio website!
This repository contains the source code for my online portfolio, where I showcase my work in data science, tools I build, and other technical projects I'm working on or have completed.

Here you'll find:

    📊 Data science projects and case studies

    🛠️ Custom tools, scripts, and utilities

    🧠 Machine learning experiments and models

    🔬 Explorations in data analysis and automation

This website will grow over time as I learn and build more—stay tuned!

Feel free to explore, leave feedback, or connect with me!
